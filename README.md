# Calculator

A simple calculator app built to explore new features on Vue 3, like the composition API, in use with Typescript, and tailwind CSS.

Repo referenced by [Lachlan Miller](https://github.com/lmiller1990) (Cypress and Vue team member) on [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guC3PmR-at0), as an example of refactoring Vue 3 apps to the composable architecture.

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) - "An open-source language which builds on JavaScript, adding static type definitions."
